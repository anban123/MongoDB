#### NPM Packages:

#### Summary:
In this assignment I created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. The app uses Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news from other sites and displays the headlines, summarys, urls, and photos (if they exist) of articles. I have it on Github and deployed on Heroku.
